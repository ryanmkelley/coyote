# Knightscope — Company Deep Dive

## Why?
Knightscope Robotics has excellent funding and press and pioneered a Robotics As A Service business model, but so far appears woefully under utilized. 

## Overview
**Knightscope, Inc.** was founded on **April 4, 2013**, in Mountain View, California, motivated by major public safety incidents (Sandy Hook, 9/11, Boston Marathon) to develop autonomous security robotics.
Their mission: __“to make the United States of America the safest country in the world.”__

---

## Founders & Early Vision
- **Founders:** William Santana Li (former Ford exec) and Stacy Dean Stephens (former Dallas police officer).  
- **First product launched in 2015:** the outdoor **K5 Autonomous Security Robot**, designed to patrol without weapons, using sensors like thermal imaging, license-plate recognition, and environmental monitoring.

---

## Funding & Financial Milestones
- **Early funding:** Raised over **$40M** via a mix of equity financing and crowdfunding since inception.
- **2017 raise:** Approx **$20M**, and later generated another **$21.91M** via StartEngine (crowdfunding).
- **IPO:** Listed on NASDAQ (Ticker: KSCP) on **January 27, 2022**, raising further capital and expanding visibility.

## Products & Pricing Approach

### Product lineup:
- **K5** – Outdoor autonomous rover (most recognizable; bullet-shaped, patrolling ~1–3 mph).
- **K3** – Indoor robot (launched 2016).
- **K1** – Stationary scanner/tower for gun detection and access points (introduced 2018).
- **K7** – All-terrain, 4-wheel mobile platform.
- **K1 Blue Light devices** – Emergency communication towers and e-phones (later added via acquisition of CASE Emergency Systems).

### Pricing model:
- **Hourly leasing:** ~$6–$12/hour (e.g., ~$6.25 in early deployments). 
- **Pioneering "Robotics-as-a-Service":** positioning security as a recurring, managed service rather than a capital pump.  

---

## Adoption & Business Traction
- **Early deployments (2015+):** initial pilots in parking lots and campuses. 
- **2020s actual use:** robots deployed at airports, self-storage facilities (e.g., San Antonio airport K5 at ~$21K/year rental). 
- **Footprint:** 80–90 robots under contract during IPO period.

---

## Financials & Market Positioning
- **H1 2021 Revenue:** $1.8M (8.6% YoY growth).  
- **Net Losses:** $19.3M in 2020, $22.7M for H1 2021—still unprofitable. 
- **Strategic partners:** Distribution channels with Allied Universal and Securitas are part of their growth. 
- **IPO strategy:** Notably, they allowed **pre-IPO crowdfunding**—offering shares first to retail investors on their own platform. 

---

## Challenges & Public Perception
- **Ethical concerns:** Criticism over surveillance overreach, privacy, job displacement, and perceived “panopticon” impact. 
- **Notable incidents:** Robots falling in public spaces (Stanford, DC fountain), collisions with children, or being vandalized.
- Despite this, some sites reported reduced vandalism and sense of deterrence (e.g., SPCA, Huntington Park, Las Vegas).

## Summary Snapshot

Knightscope carved a unique niche by offering **autonomous security robots (ASRs)** using a **recurring revenue model** and pioneering **crowdfinanced fundraising**, culminating in a **public IPO (KSCP)**. They balance hardware deployment with media appeal and on-the-ground trials. While still financially unprofitable, they remain a top-known brand in security robotics—backed by bold marketing, recurring leases, and ethical scrutiny.
