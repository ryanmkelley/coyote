## Funding, Scale & Tech Footprint
- **Employees**: Likely in the **dozens**, not hundreds (inferred from production scale and company narrative).
- **Funding**: Seed stage; public trackers note a **$1M round** closed around **Dec 2020**. ([PitchBook Profile](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/458155-45))
- **Revenue**: LeadIQ indicates ~$750K annual revenue as of mid-2025.
- **Tech Stack**: Uses standard web tools (Shopify, reCAPTCHA, core-js) and manages e-commerce via Shopify.

## Key Takeaways
1. **Niche-focused chassis provider**: Delivers ROS-enabled, mission-agnostic UGVs, rather than domain-specific robots.
2. **Affordable, scalable model**: Low-to-mid price points and platform modularity make it attractive to researchers and small integrators.
3. **Positioning advantage**: U.S.-made platform helps access regulated environments and local universities.
4. **Room to grow**: Opportunity to layer mission-ready bundles, teleoperation enhancements, and service layers similar to an “AgileX + Teleop” offering.
