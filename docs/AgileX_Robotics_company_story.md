# AgileX Robotics — Company Deep Dive

## Overview
AgileX Robotics was founded in **2016** in the Greater Bay Area (Songshan Lake/Xbot Park, later adding a Shenzhen sales office) by DJI alum **Wei Jidong** with early teammate **Jiang Yixuan**.  
- **First product:** parking robot — discontinued after limited market fit.  
- **Pivot (late 2018):** standardized, ROS-friendly **UGV chassis** for research, education, and industrial integration.  
- **Current identity:** chassis-first company selling platforms + kits rather than complete vertical solutions.

## Sales & Revenue Signals
- **2021:** Company blog claimed **50–60 units/month** across models.  
- **2021 ASP estimate:** RMB 60–100k (tens of thousands of yuan; top model “just over RMB 100k”).  
- **2021 run-rate (estimate):** 600–720 units/year → **~US $5–11M revenue** (directional, not audited).   
- **Today:**  
  - U.S. MSRP for platforms ranges from ~$14k (SCOUT 2.0) to ~$75k+ (RANGER full-size).  
  - Healthy gross margin implied between China base prices and global retail.

## Headcount Estimates
| Source | Estimate | Citation |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Owler | 25–100 |  |
| Tracxn | 51–200 |  |
| SignalHire | 100–200 |  |

> Likely **double-digit to low-hundreds**. Plausible for a hardware firm with contract manufacturing and distributor-first GTM.

## Product Strategy
- **Platform breadth:** SCOUT (wheeled), HUNTER (Ackermann), BUNKER (tracked), RANGER (omni) + smaller platforms (LIMO, PiPER) for education/hobby.  
- **Accessory ecosystem:** ROS1/ROS2 kits, Cobot kits, autonomy stack (NAVIS).  
- **Global distribution:** Resellers in North America, Europe, and Asia; published pricing for transparency and procurement speed.  
- **SKU architecture:** Modular chassis with optional payloads; easy-to-integrate APIs.

## Pricing Examples (U.S. Resellers)
| Platform | Price (USD) | Source |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| SCOUT 2.0 | ~$14,200 |  |
| BUNKER Mini | ~$27,600 |  |
| RANGER Mini 3.0 | ~$44,800 |  |
| RANGER (full-size omni) | ~$75,900 |  |

## Strategic Notes
- **Chassis-first + kit-heavy** → scalable with global distribution and minimal direct-sales overhead.  
- **Ecosystem seeding:** Low-cost edu/research platforms create long-term brand lock-in.  
- **High price transparency** → faster procurement cycles for universities and integrators.  
- **Product cadence:** Frequent refreshes (e.g., RANGER Mini 3.0) and small robots to capture new markets.

## Key Takeaways for Market Entry
- AgileX shows there’s sustained demand for robust, ROS-native outdoor bases at research/POC prices.  
- U.S./EU MSRP spreads indicate room to move customers into higher-margin “mission-ready” bundles.  
- Avoid direct price wars—compete by specializing in **150–300 kg payload**, **teleop-first**, industrial inspection platforms for U.S. markets.  
- Benchmark against AgileX on:
  - SKU modularity
  - Channel partnerships
  - Accessory ecosystem
  - Price transparency
